<h1>Chapter 5 Programming Algorithms & Software Testing</h1>


<body>
<h3>Phases of computer program development:</h3>


<ul>
<li>Phase 1: Understand the problem</li>
<li>Phase 2: Design an algorithm to solve the problem</li>
<li>Phase 3: Write the program code in appropriate language based on the algorithm</li>
<li>Phase 4: Enter the program and save</li>
<li>Phase 5: Execute the program</li>
<li>Phase 6: Test the program, find errors and debug, then retest</li>
<li>Phase 7: Document and evaluate the program</li>
</ul>

<h3>Programming structures:</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Sequential structure: Top-down execution</dt>
<dt>Decision structures: if/then/else</dt>
<dt>Iterative (Looping):</dt>
<dd>while loop: continue looping as long something is true</dd>
<dd>repeat/until loop: continue looping until something is true </dd>
<dd>for loop: loop a given number of times</dd>
<dt>Recursive structures:</dt>
<dd>Repeat a set of instructions as a subtask of itself</dd>
<dd>Repetition continues until:</dd>
<dd> &emsp; &emsp; degenerative case, which is a termination condition, is met </dd>
<dd> &emsp; &emsp; (degenerative case is also called a "base case")</dd>
<dl>


<h3>Two classic programming/database problems</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Sorting: Descending order/Ascending order</dt>
<dd>Sorting numbers</dd>
<dd>Sorting strings (in accordance with ASCII values)</dd>
<dt>Searching: find specific data that meet a certain criteria</dt>
<dd>In database:</dd>
<dd> &emsp; &emsp; Filters: temporary search</dd>
<dd> &emsp; &emsp; Queries: search criteria are saved so they don't have to be recreated</dd>
<dt>Two popular search techniques:</dt>
<dd>Sequential search: search from top to bottom or bottom to top, one item at a time</dd>
<dd>Binary search:</dd>
<dd> &emsp; &emsp; only works if data is SORTED first</dd>
<dd> &emsp; &emsp; start in the middle, then go to half of that, etc.</dd>
<dl>


<h3>Two classic program goals:</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Efficiency: Program takes minimal time and or resources</dt>
<dt>Correctness: Program runs in expected ways and works for all expected conditions</dt>
</dl>



<h2>Software testing and verification</h2>

<tr>
<td>Acceptance testing: </td>
<td>Verifying whether the whole system works as intended.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Integration testing: </td>
<td>Ensuring that software components or functions operate together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Unit testing: </td>
<td>Validating that each software unit performs as expected. A unit is the smallest testable component of an application.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Functional testing: </td>
<td>Checking functions by emulating business scenarios, based on functional requirements. Black-box testing is a common way to verify functions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Performance testing: </td>
<td>Testing how the software performs under different workloads. Load testing, for example, is used to evaluate performance under real-life load conditions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Regression testing: </td>
<td>Checking whether new features break or degrade functionality. Sanity testing can be used to verify menus, functions and commands at the surface level, when there is no time for a full regression test.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Stress testing: </td>
<td>Testing how much strain the system can take before it fails. Considered to be a type of non-functional testing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Usability testing:</td>
<td>Validating how well a customer can use a system or web application to complete a task.</td>
</tr>

<h3>Software testing is done to detect:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Architectural flaws</li>
<li>Poor design decisions</li>
<li>Invalid or incorrect functionality</li>
<li>Security vulnerabilities</li>
<li>Scalability issues</li>
</ul>


<h3>Testing best practices:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Continuous testing - This is when the software is released but may still have some bugs, so the developer continues testing the code after the release.</li>
<li>Configuration management - This is when organizations centrally maintain assets and track what software build they want to test.</li>
<li>Service Virtualization - This simulates the services and systems that are missing or not yet completed.</li>
<li>Defect or "bug tracking" - This is monitoring defects in code.</li>
<li>Metrics and Reporting - This allows team members to share status, goals, and test results.</li>
</ul>

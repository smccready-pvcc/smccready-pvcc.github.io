		 <h2><center>The Miranda v. Arizona Case and Outcome</center></h2>
		 


           
		   
		    <p style="margin-left:150px; margin-right:50px;font-size: 1.2em;"> &emsp; &emsp; Does this sound familiar? “You have the right to remain silent, anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law,
			you have the right to the presence of an attorney, if you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided for you prior to any questioning if you so desire.(uscourts.gov)”
			If you have watched any film or tv show that has to do with criminal justice, you will have heard these “Miranda” rights read to someone that is getting arrested. 
			The Supreme Court case Miranda v. Arizona is where this quote originated from. So let’s get into what exactly happened and find out why law enforcement is required to state 
			these rights to a suspect every time they make an arrest.</p>
 
            <p style="margin-left:150px; margin-right:50px;font-size: 1.2em;"> &emsp; &emsp; According to uscourts.gov, the background behind this case was that a man with the last name Miranda was arrested and questioned by law enforcement without being told that
			he had the constitutional right to not incriminate himself. After his arrest, Miranda proceeded to make statements about his guilt after a two hour interrogation. His confession was
			later used against him in court where he was found guilty of the charges brought against him. There were a couple of other court cases that this ruling also addressed that were 
			similar situations; namely Vignera v. New York, Westover v. United States, and California v. Stewart.</p>
 
            <p style="margin-left:150px; margin-right:50px;font-size: 1.2em;"> &emsp; &emsp; One issue being debated was in this case was basically whether what the accused individual said while in police custody was allowed as courtroom evidence, and if it was 
			necessary to remind him of his 5th amendment right to, “Not be compelled to incriminate himself.” The court ruled that the United States Constitution held the undeniable 
			and obvious point that the right of a person to not incriminate themselves should be upheld. Therefore, the court stated that measures must be taken to make certain that 
			the accused individual knows that anything that they say, “can and will be used against them”. (uscourts.gov)</p>
 
            <p style="margin-left:150px; margin-right:50px;font-size: 1.2em;"> &emsp; &emsp; In addition to this, Coletti talks about how the court wanted to make for certain that the interrogation techniques used by law enforcement also upheld the fundamental
			rights of the accused individual. In many instances, law enforcement would place the suspect in a set of conditions such as unfamiliar or intimidating surroundings. 
			They would also use lying and other verbal methods to get the accused to confess or get the accused in a mentally vulnerable position that would eventually lead to a 
			confession. To combat this, the court ruled that the accused must be informed of their constitutional right to not incriminate themselves and that if they decided to give a 
			confession and incriminate themselves, they must do so, “voluntary, intelligently, and knowingly”. (Coletti, 2017)</p>
 
            <p style="margin-left:150px; margin-right:50px;font-size: 1.2em;"> &emsp; &emsp; Justia Law states that the Miranda v. Arizona case was argued in the United States Supreme Court from Feb 28<sup>th</sup> through March 1<sup>st</sup> in 1966. (Justia Law) According to 
			uscourts.gov, the final decision was made on June 13<sup>th</sup>, 1966, with a very close vote: 5 voting in favor of Miranda and 4 against. (uscourts.gov) This case set the precedent 
			that we now see with every arrest made. Officers must “Mirandize” every individual they arrest, and it can cause problems with getting a conviction if they do not.</p>
 
            <p style="margin-left:150px; margin-right:50px;font-size: 1.2em;"> &emsp; &emsp; Miranda was later convicted for his crimes, even though the Supreme court ruled in his favor. The State of Arizona later brought up the case again and retried him. He was 
			convicted without the court using his confession as evidence (he had not been read his rights so it could not be evidence in the court) and given a 20–30 year jail sentence 
			for his crimes. (uscourts.gov) It was a long and drawn-out process to get a ruling for one man, but the Miranda. v. Arizona case created a precedent that has had lasting effects 
			that we still see today.</p>
